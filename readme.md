# JavaScript 30

This is my fork of [Wes Bos' JS30 Course](https://javascript30.com).

I want to document what I learn throughout the process here.

## Drum Kit

1. Data Attributes are useful for custom attributes on HTML elements when other attributes aren't right. You specify them as `data-<name>` and can use CSS/JS selectors on them.
2. You can interpolate values into selectors.
3. Audio has a method called `currentTime` which you can set to 0 to restart the audio. It also has a `play()` method.
4. 'transitionend' is an event.
5. All keys have a specific event keycode. See [keycode.info](http://keycode.info).

## Clock

1. Chrome DevTools has a little thing you can click to adjust your `transition-timing-function` curve.
2. `setInterval()` is provided two parameters. The first is the function/expression. The second is the specified interval in milliseconds. It calls the function/expression every specified interval.
3. Things have origins that you can transform.
